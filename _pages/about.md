I recently graduated from the Technical University of Munich with a master's degree in Mechatronics and Robotics. During my master's studies, I completed a thesis titled "Understand Human-Object Interaction in Scene for Human-Robot Collaboration" under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Darius Burschka. Prior to this, I worked as a Quality Engineer at Unilever. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design and Manufacturing and Automation from Hefei University of Technology.
